Your latest proficiency check answers are now almost entirely right.  Efficiency
is indeed the weakest metric of the menus/forms/dialogs interaction style.

Your explanation and your fix, however, are in the right direction but not paint
a complete picture.  In your explanation, for example, you seem to imply that
recognizable and clear objects automatically make something inefficient; that is
not the case.  You do say that menus are not focused on rapid access, and that
would be correct, but you never quite get to a specific reason why access to
menus might not be as fast as possible.

Your fix, which is to make menu items larger and possibly skeuomorphic, has
potential to address the efficiency issue but not in a general sense.  In other
words, this fix will not guarantee improved efficiency for all menus.  There is
a fix that does---and it is related to the specific reason for why menus, by
default, tend to not be very efficient.

For the first part of the proficiency check, regarding the strength of the
menus/forms/dialogs interaction style, you got everything totally right.

1a, 1b, 1d: +

For the second part, regarding the weakness of menus/forms/dialogs, you
actually end up in a bit of a contradiction.  If a system is highly learnable,
then it follows that it is memorable, because learnability means that a user
can figure it out quickly without prior expsoure.  Thus, said user will not
have an issue with figuring out a learnable system again after being away
from it for a while!

So you need to think about this further.  Review the handouts and the textbook
(even if you did not buy it, I believe there is a copy in the Keck lab, and
there are copies in the library).

This answer detracts from your prior proficiency because it reveals a
significant misunderstanding of how these metrics interact.
