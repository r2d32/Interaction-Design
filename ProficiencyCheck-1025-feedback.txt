For the first part of the proficiency check, regarding the strength of the
menus/forms/dialogs interaction style, you got everything totally right.

For the second part, regarding the weakness of menus/forms/dialogs, you
actually end up in a bit of a contradiction.  If a system is highly learnable,
then it follows that it is memorable, because learnability means that a user
can figure it out quickly without prior expsoure.  Thus, said user will not
have an issue with figuring out a learnable system again after being away
from it for a while!

So you need to think about this further.  Review the handouts and the textbook
(even if you did not buy it, I believe there is a copy in the Keck lab, and
there are copies in the library).

This answer detracts from your prior proficiency because it reveals a
significant misunderstanding of how these metrics interact.
